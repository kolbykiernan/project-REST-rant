# Project REST-Rant

REST-Rant is an app where users can rate and review restaurants. The project was built with Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose and MongoDB (non-realational db), and React.js/JSX and focuses on RESTful API's and basic CRUD operations. As my first back-end project, this is a simplified version of Yelp that allows users to interact with a web application that is making requests to a server and returning responses based on the user's actions. Since I was learning as I was building this, the biggest learning curve was understanding when and where to intall packages, and importing/exporting them and other files thorughout my code. By the end of the project, I can explain how each line of code contributes to the ultimate goal of building this app.  I would like to implement more drop-downs (such as cuisine type, or location), so that I can categorize restaurants. By doing this, this opens up the ability for users to filter through restaurants based on rating, type of cuisines, locations (I understand this would be a big project).
